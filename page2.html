			<h3>COMPANION PROGRAM</h3>

			<div class="post-blurb">
				<p>Perhaps you are interested in charity work and wish to make a certain contribution to the Foundation, but not in financial form. You are always welcome to be Wardatul Jannah's Friend.</p>
				<p>Material contributions are not everything. It is well known that financial and material contributions help meet physical needs for food, clothing and shelter; but these children without a perfect family need other fillings that help develop their minds, souls and spirits.</p>

			<h3>FREIND'S RESPONSIBILITIES</h3>

			<div class="post-blurb">
				<p>As a Friend of Wardatul Jannah, you can help the Foundation by contributing through the following:</p>
			<ul class="point">
				<li>1.Develop the academic side of children through extra classes or voluntary free tuition</li>
				<li>2.Develop the creative side through "art and craft" classes</li>
				<li>3.Manage recreational programs</li>
				<li>4.Become a volunteer who helps the party</li>
			</ul
				<p>The Foundation carries out certain projects. It all depends on your own will, ability and willingness.</p>

			<h3>KNOW YOUR STRENGTHS AND EXPERTISE PROFESSIONAL FRIEND</h3>

			<div class="post-blurb">
				<p><strong>Professional Friend</strong></p>
				<p>You may have ICT expertise and be proficient in using the latest equipment and software that is beneficial to children. You may be able to spend 1 hour a week or 2 hours a month to teach children how to use Microsoft Office software to help them prepare school assignments more sophisticated and effective. You can also educate them to use the computer to find useful information, either to increase general knowledge or improve their understanding of topics taught in school.</p>
				<p>You may be a nutritionist who can provide appropriate nutritional advice, either to the orphans placed in Wardatul Jannah, our cook or the mothers of the children of Wardatul Jannah (we hold a meeting once a month with the mothers of the children- this child) because these mothers can also take advantage of this knowledge when raising their small children or daughters who are not placed in Wardatul Jannah.</p>
				<p>You may be a doctor who can provide free health screening services. If you are a dentist, you may be able to offer dental services at a special rate or even better, for free!</p>
				<p>Whether you are an accountant or an engineer or a lawyer or whatever, your generous nature can certainly give you ideas on how to share your expertise with the Foundation.</p>
    				<p>Even if you are a writer or journalist, maybe you can spread information about our information in the media you are fighting for...</p>
				
				<p><strong>Student Friend</strong></p>
				<p>If you are a high school student or a student of a higher education institution, you can plan activities that can be carried out in Wardatul Jannah through the clubs and associations you join. For example, as a member of the Career Club, you can arrange a career guidance session for these younger siblings. If you are a member of the Adventure Club, you can organize a recreation program to give exposure to the residents here. In fact, you may be able to help instill the spirit of entrepreneurship among these orphans through a fundraising program run by your Entrepreneurship Club.</p>
				<p>As an activist of the arts and literature club, help them polish their hidden talents – who knows their painful life experiences might be turned into beautiful works! If you lead the Martial Arts Club, share martial arts knowledge so you don't become a victim of bullying.</p>
				<p>Scouts or Red Crescent Society or Girl Guides – there's so much you can contribute to us!</p>
				
				<p><strong>Suri's friend</strong></p>
				<p>Many housewives feel like they can't help, either because of certain constraints. Inaccurate! You can actually help. Who knows, you might have some delicious special recipes to share. Whether you cook yourself at home and then donate to these children, or come to cook at Wardatul Jannah yourself, or help teach our cooks – everything means a lot to us.</P>
				<p>You can also help, who knows, sew the buttons of the child's shirt that have come off or sew the hem of the child's pant legs. Just be aware' we may not have time or delay time to deliver it to the tailor's shop.</p>
